# Projects

This site compiles many of my personal projects, which range from algorithm implementations to completed games.  My personal development time is often split 50/50 between long-term game projects and short term experiments & exercises.

## History

I've been working on independent & personal projects since 2010.  My habit so far has been to post clips and screenshots to social media and then let them sit in my github account until I need to reference them, but I'm hoping to collect & curate them here for interested parties.  Note that not all projects will include source.

The simplest of these projects is often implementing something interesting I've seen, just to feel out the algorithm and to understand it beyond the theoretical.  [[Wave Function Collapse Experiments]] is a great example of this.

At the other end of the spectrum are larger projects that I work on for months or years at a time.
